                                    Currently I am working as a employee of the company. Now Iâ€™ve studying at FPT Polytechnic (HCM), Teenager as a Front-end Developer.

                                    I find my self as a creative, reliable and detailed freelancer who can work independently without too many detailed instructions. I have a principle that is "stay simple and stay humble". I believe that in simplicity there is a complexity and  very deep thoroughness. I see every project as a process of solving a problem. Then it is time for your problems to be resolved in detail, in depth, and of course in simplicity.
